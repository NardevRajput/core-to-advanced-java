# Core to Advanced Java 🚀

This repository contains my complete Java learning journey, from core concepts to advanced topics.  
I have implemented every example and solved 115 practice questions by myself.

- Control Flow: if-else, switch, loops
- Methods & Recursion
- Arrays & Strings

### ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors, `this`, `static`, memory model

  - Custom Exceptions
  - FileReader, FileWriter
  - Collections & Generics
  - List, Set, Map, Queue
  - Enums, Wrapper Classes, Diamond Operator
  - Multithreading
  - Thread lifecycle, synchronization
  - `wait` / `notify`, `join`

## 📝 Practice Work
- Solved 115 coding questions** for hands-on practice.
- Each topic folder has small programs + exercises.
- Focused mainly on Core + Advanced Java concepts**.

## 🔗 Upcoming Work
I am currently working on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Java separately.  
For that, a new dedicated repository will be created:`DSA-with-Java`.  
This way, core-to-advanced concepts stay separate from detailed DSA implementations.
