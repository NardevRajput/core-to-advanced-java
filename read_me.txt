# Core to Advanced Java 🚀

This repository contains my complete Java learning journey, from **core concepts to advanced topics**.  
I have implemented every example and solved **115 practice questions** by myself (no copy-paste) while following a structured course PDF.

## 📝 Practice Work
- Solved **115+ coding questions** for hands-on practice.
- Each topic folder has small programs + exercises.
- Focused mainly on **Core + Advanced Java concepts**.

## 🔗 Upcoming Work
I am currently working on **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Java** separately.  
For that, a new dedicated repository will be created: **`DSA-with-Java`**.  
This way, core-to-advanced concepts stay separate from detailed DSA implementations.
